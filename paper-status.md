## TODO Modelling

 - Compute a_0 via optimization
 - Calculate lag time from the inputs
 - ~Currently running new runs with boundary forcing instead of ICs on magnus (9/11/2018)~
 - ~Extract the CRUX nearbed velocity data for an independent validation~
 - ~Check definition of alpha and r10 in the paper~
 
## TODO Paper

 - Introduction w/ motivation
 - ~Writeup vkdv model equations and discretisation~
 - ~Update how the model is forced (boundary conditions instead of ICs)~
 - Site background section (5.2)
 - Bayesian method for density profile initial condition
 - Bayesian method for a0 initial condition
 - Results
 - Velocity validation description

 - Key result to show is the "Amax vs Ls" plot 
 - Optimization approach (Discussion)

## TODO Figures

 - Grid convergence test cases results (needs improving)
 - a_0 vs ssh figure (needs improving)
 - Stratification fit examples
 - Time-series of model inputs (A_obs, a_0, eta)
