## TODO Modelling

 - Compute a_0 via optimization
 - ~Currently running new runs with boundary forcing instead of ICs on magnus (9/11/2018)~
 - ~Extract the CRUX nearbed velocity data for an independent validation~
 - ~Check definition of alpha and r10 in the paper~
 
## TODO Paper

 - Introduction w/ motivation
 - Writeup vkdv model equations and discretisation
 - Update how the model is forced (boundary conditions instead of ICs)
 - Key result to show is the "Amax vs Ls" plot
 - Bayesian method for density profile initial condition
 - Bayesian method for a0 initial condition
 - Much more...
