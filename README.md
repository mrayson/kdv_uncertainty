# Scripts and notebooks for nonlinear internal wave uncertainty analysis study

Used to generate figures and test ideas for the following papers:

Manderson et al., 2018, Uncertainty quantification of density and stratification estimates with implications for predicting ocean dynamics, **to be submitted to JAOTEC**

Rayson et al., 2018, Prediction of nonlinear internal wave amplitude in shelf seas with uncertainty quantification, **in preparation**
